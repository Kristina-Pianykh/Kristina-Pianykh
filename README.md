## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Kristina-Pianykh/Kristina-Pianykh** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

### A few things to get to know me...

- I use neovim btw (check out my [config](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/neovim-config))
- I'm a Primeagen fan btw
- I'm currently working on a neovim [plugin](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/nvim-databricks) for executing Python code on a remote Databricks cluster
- I like to keep my envrionment clean so I use home-manager to define it [declaratively in Nix](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/home-manager)
- I'm a sucker for "low-level" things, be that CPU caching, OS scheduling, compiler design or encryption algorithms. The things I particularly enjoyed working on: [CPU emulation](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/RISC-V-emulator), [bootloader](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/bootloader), [Deffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/dh-hash-collisions-rs)
- Professionally, I have a broad experience with cloud infrastructure, containerization and deployments (see a [toy AWS project](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/terraform-aws-test-infrastructure) for a BE request service and a simple [deployment infrastructure](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/streamlit-azure-demo) for a Streamlit app on Azure)
- I've also "dipped my toes" in distributed data streaming, including complex event processing (see a [wrapper](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/flink-multinode) around Flink Java library) and [multi-node networking in an IoT cluster](https://github.com/Kristina-Pianykh/iot_distributed_event_processing) of Raspberry Pis and smartwatches
